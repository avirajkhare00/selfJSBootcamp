Absolutely! Here are **3 functional programming projects** and **3 object-oriented programming (OOP) projects** in JavaScript. These projects will help you (or your students) practice and solidify the concepts of both paradigms.

### **Functional Programming Projects**

Functional programming emphasizes **pure functions**, **immutability**, and **higher-order functions**. These projects focus on those principles.

---

#### 1. **Todo List with Pure Functions**
   - **Description:** Build a todo list application where all operations (adding, deleting, updating tasks) are performed using pure functions.
   - **Key Concepts:**
     - Immutable data (no direct modification of arrays/objects).
     - Higher-order functions like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.
   - **Example Features:**
     - Add a task.
     - Mark a task as completed.
     - Filter tasks (e.g., show only completed tasks).
   - **Challenge:** Avoid using `let` or `var`â€”only use `const`.

---

#### 2. **Budget Tracker**
   - **Description:** Create a budget tracker that calculates income, expenses, and savings using functional programming principles.
   - **Key Concepts:**
     - Pure functions for calculations (e.g., `calculateTotalIncome`, `calculateTotalExpenses`).
     - Immutable data for transactions.
   - **Example Features:**
     - Add income or expenses.
     - Calculate the total balance.
     - Display a summary of transactions.
   - **Challenge:** Use `reduce` to calculate totals.

---

#### 3. **Quiz App**
   - **Description:** Build a quiz app where questions and answers are stored in an array, and the app uses functional programming to handle user input and scoring.
   - **Key Concepts:**
     - Pure functions for checking answers and calculating scores.
     - Higher-order functions to process the quiz data.
   - **Example Features:**
     - Display one question at a time.
     - Check if the userâ€™s answer is correct.
     - Show the final score at the end.
   - **Challenge:** Use `map` to display questions and `reduce` to calculate the score.

### **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Projects**

OOP focuses on **classes**, **objects**, **inheritance**, and **encapsulation**. These projects will help you practice these concepts.

---

#### 1. **Library Management System**
   - **Description:** Create a system to manage books in a library using OOP principles.
   - **Key Concepts:**
     - Classes for `Book` and `Library`.
     - Methods to add, remove, and search for books.
   - **Example Features:**
     - Add a book with title, author, and ISBN.
     - Remove a book by ISBN.
     - Search for a book by title or author.
   - **Challenge:** Use inheritance to create a subclass for `EBook` that extends `Book`.

---

#### 2. **Bank Account System**
   - **Description:** Simulate a simple bank account system where users can create accounts, deposit, withdraw, and check balances.
   - **Key Concepts:**
     - Classes for `BankAccount`.
     - Encapsulation to protect sensitive data (e.g., balance).
   - **Example Features:**
     - Create an account with an account number and initial balance.
     - Deposit and withdraw money.
     - Display the account balance.
   - **Challenge:** Add a `SavingsAccount` class that inherits from `BankAccount` and includes an interest rate.

---

#### 3. **Online Store**
   - **Description:** Build a simple online store where users can add products to a cart and checkout.
   - **Key Concepts:**
     - Classes for `Product`, `Cart`, and `Order`.
     - Methods to add/remove products and calculate totals.
   - **Example Features:**
     - Add products to the cart.
     - Remove products from the cart.
     - Calculate the total price of items in the cart.
   - **Challenge:** Use encapsulation to ensure the cartâ€™s contents can only be modified through methods.

---

### **Why These Projects?**
- **Functional Programming Projects:** These focus on immutability, pure functions, and higher-order functions, which are core to functional programming.
- **OOP Projects:** These emphasize classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation, which are the pillars of OOP.
